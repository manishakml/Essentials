/* LC 272
 * Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
 * Note:
 * Given target value is a floating point.
 * You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
 * You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
 * Follow up:
 * Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?

    /* Tested.
     * Note: Reason why inorder works for BST: Inorder on bst gives a sorted array. To find k val closest to x, we have to look at the neighbors of x (k times). this is optimized since we get a sorted array.
     * Time complexity: O(n)
     * Space complexity: O(k) for queue or O(log n) for call stack
