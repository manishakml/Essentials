# Essentials
This is a repository I maintain for all my coding exercises and any relevant/interesting codes/designs I come across.

TODO:
1. Time/space complexity analysis:
a. Nested list weight
b. Factor combinations.
c. Merge k lists - all approaches
2. Good explanation of permutations-ii without using 'next' permutation approach.
3. Paint house when houses are arranged in a circle: Reuse same logic, except for the last row. For the last row, find 3 minimum of last-1th row instead of 2 minimum. Why? Coz one might clash with itself, the other might clash with 0th row (which has already been 'painted'). Will this logic work or is there a better one?
