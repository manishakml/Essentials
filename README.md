# Practice
This is a repository I maintain for all my coding exercises and any relevant/interesting codes/designs I come across.

TODO:
1. Time/space complexity analysis:
a. Nested list weight
b. Factor combinations.
c. Merge k lists - all approaches
2. Good explanation of permutations-ii without using 'next' permutation approach.
3. Paint house when houses are arranged in a circle: Reuse same logic, except for the last row. For the last row, find 3 minimum of last-1th row instead of 2 minimum. Why? Coz one might clash with itself, the other might clash with 0th row (which has already been 'painted'). Will this logic work or is there a better one?
4. Add interval and getTotalLength. Merge in getLength() vs merge in Add. Tradeoffs. RemoveRange and RemoveInterval implementation TBD.
5. Verify triangles(all variations) and identify O(nlgn) algorithm for listing triangles, if any.
6. bst-ser-deser: verify stoi error.
7. Union/intersection of ll: Union - how to handle duplicates inherently. Intersection - what's the intended result of intersection of (1,2,3) and (2,2)? Is it (2) or (2,2)?
8. Implement hash table: 1) How to instatntiate HashTable class?, 2) Try to implement Remove, 3) Add concurrency.
